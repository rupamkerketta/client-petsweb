                Petsweb is a system designed for the welfare of the animals. It is an application that any user with or without a pet can access. If you are a user with a pet and you have to go outstation or just take a break from your pet, then you can put it on the Petsweb foster page and a user with or without a pet who is interested to take care of the animal can apply for taking care of the pet. Petsweb offers options like stray animal adoption or Animal rescue where you can take a picture and directly be in contact with the NGOâ€™s through the Petsweb portal. It is a computer-based system that aims to improve safety for animals, not let them starve and find a home for them.
